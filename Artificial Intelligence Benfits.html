    		<h3> Benfits of Artificial Intelligence:<h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>SAVING TIME – TASK AUTOMATION AND REDUCING ERRORS<h4> 
					<h5>Both AI and blockchain are technologies that serve to minimize labor-intensive and non-trivial tasks through automation in complex analytical processes – with great outcomes. According to a study conducted by PwC in 2018, AI-based automation will increase the GDP of the US to $15 trillion by 2030, according to Reuters – especially since it can take over admin tasks like creating personalized emails or sending invoices, leaving employees with more time to focus on productive tasks.</h5>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>COST REDUCTION AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY</h4>
					<h5>Efficiency and cost reduction are amongst some of the benefits of artificial intelligence. For example, AI-based CRMs allow marketers and salespeople to maximize their lead generation and retention efforts within budget, by providing relevant insights based on customer feedback. Overall, IDC estimates that AI-powered CRM activities will boost global business revenue by $1.1 trillion, increase productivity by $121 billion and lower expenses through automation by $265 billion! </h5>
					</li>

					<h4>CHANGING THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT LANDSCAPE</h4>
					<h5>The benefits of artificial intelligence are not restricted to self-driving cars or automated chatbots. As 75% (according to WSJ) of all venture-backed startups fail, AI algorithms will allow investors to make more informed decisions. Hence, within the scope of capital markets, AI can be used to mine and analyze historical data such as revenue growth, industry experience, market size, etc. to predict a startup’s success</h5>
